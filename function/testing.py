# Function and Method 

# what is parameter ?
# 
# 3 no param has reurn

# only print show text 

# =============form=============
# name .....
# age .......


# 4 has parameter and has return

# function is a block code 
# funcion has 4 kind :
# 1 No param and No retrun  : only print text, something 
# 2 No param and has return : only can asign value to other variable
# 3 Has param and no return : for user input dynamic, can not asign value to other varible 
# 4 has param and has return : for user input dynamic, user can be asign value to toher variable 

# practice for function :

# pls create funtion like below :
# 1 No param and No retrun  
# 2 No param and has return 
# 3 Has param and no return 
# 4 has param and has return


# Pratice of function #3
# create one function can caculate of 2 value 

# result :

# 2 + 2 = 4
# 2 - 2 = 0
# 2 * 2 = 4
# 2 / 2 = 1

def caculate(a,b):
    
    print(a,"+",b,"=",a+b)
    print(a,"-",b,"=",a-b)
    print(a,"*",b,"=",a*b)
    print(a,"/",b,"=",a/b)
caculate(2,2)
